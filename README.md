# stock-analysis
Module 2 challenge 

There are 2 sets of vba scripts that I ran. This code is not efficient but it did work. The first set was to obtain  the columns and whatnot then the open and close stock prices along with the tickers. the second set of scripts combines things into one sheet to generate the greatest and lowest % totals.
